Recognition of facial emotion has been a challenge for many years. A real-time facial expression recognition system using deep learning technology can be used in applicationssuchasbiometricsecurity,intelligenthuman-computerinteraction,robotics, andclinicalmedicineforautism,depression,painandmentalhealthproblems. Classical approachestomachinelearningoftenrequireacomplexprocessofextractionoffeatures and produce poor results. In this thesis, we are applying the latest developments in deep learning to propose effective deep convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can accurately interpret facially accessible semantic data without hand-designed feature descriptors. In order to learn CNNs with a strong classification power, we also apply different loss functions and training techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed networks outperform state-of-the-art techniques on the well-known FERC-2013 dataset provided by Kaggle facial expression recognition competition. The number of parameters in our proposed networks has drastically decreased, accelerating the performance speed and makes the proposed networks suitable for real-time systems.
